Council on International Educational Exchange - Alaska

A website for my friend who helps place foreign exchange students, usually high school age, in the Wasilla, Alaska area.  It will be used by site admins, host families, the students, and the students' families for organizing activities and socializing with the other members, as well as a portal for parents of the exchange students to see updates.
